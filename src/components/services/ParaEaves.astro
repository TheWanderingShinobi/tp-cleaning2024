            Eavestrough cleaning is an important part of home maintenance that
            is often overlooked. Your eavestroughs are responsible for directing
            rainwater away from your home's foundation, preventing damage to
            your property. Eavestroughs are an essential component of your
            home's drainage system. They play a vital role in directing
            rainwater and melting snow away from your roof and foundation,
            preventing water damage to your property. Over time, eavestroughs
            can become clogged with leaves, twigs, and other debris, impeding
            their function and leading to costly damage. If your eavestroughs
            are clogged with debris, they can't do their job effectively, which
            can lead to costly repairs down the line.

            The Importance of Cleaning Your Eavestroughs

            <li>
                <span class="text-accent">Prevent Water Damage:</span> When your
                eavestroughs are clogged, rainwater and melting snow cannot flow
                freely through them. Instead, the water can pool up and overflow,
                leading to water damage to your roof, walls, and foundation. Regular
                cleaning helps prevent this damage and prolongs the lifespan of your
                home.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-accent">Avoid Pest Infestations:</span> Clogged
                eavestroughs can also attract pests such as rodents, birds, and insects.
                These pests can cause damage to your home and pose health risks to
                your family. Cleaning your eavestroughs regularly can help avoid
                these issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-accent">Maintain Curb Appeal:</span> Dirty, clogged
                eavestroughs can detract from the overall appearance of your home.
                Regular cleaning helps maintain your home's curb appeal and enhances
                its value.
